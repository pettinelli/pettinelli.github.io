<h3 class="grid_16 group">Robert Pettinelli</h3>
<div class="grid_11">
<p>Robert Pettinelli graduated from Syracuse University in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in Construction Management. After receiving his degree, he went to work at his father’s structural steel shop. Tony’s Iron, a miscellaneous metal fabricator shop in Rome, New York, allowed Robert to gain knowledge of steel fabrication and quality. On the weekends Robert began installing Miracle Play Equipment in New England and New York. In 1990, Robert left the family business and moved to Vermont where he was employed by Action Equipment Company out of Candia, New Hampshire, as a salesman. In this position, Robert learned how to operate and respect heavy equipment and continued to install Miracle Play Equipment.</p>
<p>In 1993, Robert was asked to join Miracle as a sub-representative. Robert worked under the supervision of Gibbons Recreation, selling and installing Miracle Play Equipment until 1995 when Miracle gave him his own territory.</p>

<h3 class="grid_16 group">Justin Mansfield</h3>
<div class="grid_11">
<p>Justin Mansfield began working as a field installer for Pettinelli &amp; Associates in 2001 just a month after graduating from The University of Vermont. For four years Justin honed his understanding of playground systems, focusing on both equipment and functionality. This dedication allowed him to take over as foreman and in 2009 join Bob in sales and design. Justin has become an invaluable leader in the office and remains a seasoned foreman in the field. </p>
<p> Justin is a wealth of knowledge-not just in playground equipment, but in what feels like everything. We know Justin for his sharp intellect and personable nature, as do all who have worked alongside him in Community builds. </p>
